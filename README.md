# cloud function batch python 

_In this project we find a cloud function in gcp using the FLASK framework  calling by bucket trigger  that executes a batch prediction of model sentiment analisys_

## Starting üöÄ

_To get the project on your local machine please clone the repository with the name of **cloud_function_python**, remember that you must have permission from the organization_

### Pre requirements üìã

_This project must be run directly in a GCP cloud function with **Python 3.10** language or if desired it can also be run directly in your virtual machine with some modifications. You must install the following dependencies in the cloud function or environment vrtual contained in the file requirements.txt_

```
pip install -r requeriments.txt
```
_In the cloud function it is only necessary to load the file, once it is done DEPLOY it, the dependencies will be installed automatically_


###installation üîß


1.a cloud function must be created in GCP with a trigger of  bucket to make the batch we will modify diferent paths where we will to **procesing, input, output of the data**, also we neeed to modify our **project id, model id, location, job_name**.
however we need to remmeber thsi project create a jsonl file due in this way was buit the model of **sentimemt analysis**  to understand more about how to built a make batch prediction see the **links** of this readme.to modify this params see the file **params.py**


```
'self.project_id = "284757810904"'

'self.model_id_off_site ="5835259941211865088"'

'self.input_uri = "gs://batch_predictions_sentiment/Prediction_Masive_Sentiment/Main_Control_Batch/Prediction_Main_Batch.jsonl"'

'self.output_uri = "gs://batch_predictions_sentiment/Prediction_Masive_Sentiment/Prosecing_Masive_Data/"'

'self.location="us-central1"'

'self.job_display_name = "new_job"'

'self.Processing_Batch = "gs://batch_predictions_sentiment/Prediction_Masive_Sentiment/Prosecing_Masive_Data/"'
 
 'self.Path_Control = "gs://batch_predictions_sentiment/Prediction_Masive_Sentiment/Main_Control_Batch/"'
 
 'self.complement_ini = "{\'content\' :\'gs://batch_predictions_sentiment/Prediction_Masive_Sentiment/Prosecing_Masive_Data/"'
 
  'self.complement_end = ".txt\', \'mimeType\': \'text/plain\'}"'


```

## running the tests ‚öôÔ∏è


_The cloud function is at its maximum performance, this batch is to make a batch more or less 7000 registers. In the event that it is more gigantic in the future, a more scalable solution must be implemented with another google cloud service, but we are referring to perhaps more than 50 gb of processing, for now the cloud function, being designed with OOP, is relatively very stable and scalable_

###Analyze end-to-end testsüî©


_If the whole process is executed correctly,if the cloud function response is all succeded will show this message **JobState.JOB_STATE_SUCCEEDED** on GCP logs however before appear the next  messages_

```
The Params is: Ok
The Data is: Ok
The sentiment export to list is: Ok
The sentiment already exported to txt : Ok
The Paths  prediction exported : OK 
Prediction Batch: ok

```

### coding style ‚å®Ô∏è

_This program was completely modularized through object-oriented programming and also attempted to be codified under the **pep 8** regime._
